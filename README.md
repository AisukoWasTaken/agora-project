## Bugs and feature requests

If you find a bug or need a new feature, please report it [here on Github](https://github.com/xech/agora-project/issues)

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and a live example. You can use CodePen to fork any demo found on documentation to use it as a template.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
